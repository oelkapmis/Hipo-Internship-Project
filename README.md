# Hipo-Internship-Project

I started the project on 07.03.2020, given tasks were require some knowledge on: SearchView, ListView, read-write from-to JSON file, MVVM or MVP designs, and Kotlin language.
To be honest, this is the first time I encounter these topics. Anyway, I spent my first week doing research. On 13.03.2020, I started coding with the help of video tutorials and online documents.
I managed to read from JSON file and display all members in the listView (even though I had to manipulate the JSON file a little)
After that, I tried many ways to set a filter to SearchView but had a problem every time. To avoid wasting my time, I left it as it is, and turned to 'Add New Member' button.
To get user input, I needed to create a new page and decided to create an ''AddingActivity'' which users can put data and save.
Succeeded to create a new page and take data from user, but saving part was a trouble again. All my 'writing to JSON file' attempts failed.
I had two days left and decided to pass this task as well. For last two days, I created MVP's interface and class files and reorganize my codes according to MVP structure.
Actually, It was so close to make my project work properly with MVP design except a few little errors but I had no time left and removed MVP design.
Even though my project didn't perform a significant part of the assigned tasks, I learned a lot during this two-week period. It was a good challenge for me. I made a good start to android programming and I will continue to learn.
